/**
 * Idea:
 * 1. Start with the recursive backtracking solution
 * 2. Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down dynamic programming)
 * 3. Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)
 * 4. Apply final tricks to reduce the time/memory complexity
 * Requires: problems with the overlapping subproblems or optimal substructure property.
