2. [String search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm)

3. DP Common patterns

   1. Memoization: 

   2. Tabulation: trapping rain water, ugly number ii, pascal triangle series

   3. Counting: coin change series, combination sum iv, unique paths series

   4. Iteration within recurrence relation: word break

   5. State transitions: best time to buy and sell stock series

   6. Kadane algorithm: maximum subarray,
                        maximum sum circular subarray,
                        maximum product subarray,
                        maximum length of subarray with positive product

   7. Falling path sum: minimum falling path sum, triangle

   8. Edit distance: longest common subsequence, edit distance

   9. With bitmask

   10. Others: longest palindromic substring,
               longest palindromic sequence,
               longest increasing subsequence,
               wiggle subsequence,
               maximal square,
               minimum path sum
