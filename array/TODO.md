3. DP Common patterns

   1. Iteration within recurrence relation: word break

   2. Falling path sum: minimum falling path sum, triangle

   3. Edit distance: longest common subsequence, edit distance

   4. With bitmask

   5. Others: longest palindromic substring,
              longest palindromic sequence,
              longest increasing subsequence,
              wiggle subsequence,
              maximal square,
              minimum path sum
