3. DP Common patterns

   1. Counting: coin change series, combination sum iv, unique paths series

   2. Iteration within recurrence relation: word break

   3. Falling path sum: minimum falling path sum, triangle

   4. Edit distance: longest common subsequence, edit distance

   5. With bitmask

   6. Others: longest palindromic substring,
              longest palindromic sequence,
              longest increasing subsequence,
              wiggle subsequence,
              maximal square,
              minimum path sum
