2. [String search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm)

3. DP Common patterns

   1. Counting: coin change series, combination sum iv, unique paths series

   2. Iteration within recurrence relation: word break

   3. State transitions: best time to buy and sell stock series

   4. Falling path sum: minimum falling path sum, triangle

   5. Edit distance: longest common subsequence, edit distance

   6. With bitmask

   7. Others: longest palindromic substring,
              longest palindromic sequence,
              longest increasing subsequence,
              wiggle subsequence,
              maximal square,
              minimum path sum
