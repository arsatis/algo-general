2. [String search algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm)

3. DP Common patterns

   1. Counting: coin change series, combination sum iv, unique paths series

   2. Iteration within recurrence relation: word break

   3. State transitions: best time to buy and sell stock series

   4. Kadane algorithm: maximum subarray,
                        maximum sum circular subarray,
                        maximum product subarray,
                        maximum length of subarray with positive product

   5. Falling path sum: minimum falling path sum, triangle

   6. Edit distance: longest common subsequence, edit distance

   7. With bitmask

   8. Others: longest palindromic substring,
              longest palindromic sequence,
              longest increasing subsequence,
              wiggle subsequence,
              maximal square,
              minimum path sum
